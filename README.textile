h1. Roxy (A ruby proxy library)

h2. Summary

Roxy is a basic proxy library that lets you quickly create proxies between your ruby objects.  Its syntax
is loosely based on "Association Extensions in ActiveRecord":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html
as that is a well-known use of proxies.

Please see the "CHANGELOG":http://github.com/yfactorial/utility_scopes/tree/master/CHANGELOG for contribution details. 

Roxy has the following dependencies:

* rspec >= 1.1.4 (for specs only, not runtime)

h2. Installation

To install the roxy gem run the following:

  sudo gem install yfactorial-roxy --source http://gems.github.com
  
And to enable the scopes in your project just require the @roxy@ library and give your object some moxie:

  require 'roxy'
  class Person
    include Roxy::Moxie
    ...
  end
  
h2. Usage

See the announcement post at for detailed usage examples: 

Here's a basic example:

  require 'roxy'
  class Person
    include Roxy::Moxie
    
    attr_accessor :first, :last, :parents
    
    proxy :parents do
      def divorced?
        proxy_target.size > 1 and proxy_target.collect { |parent| parent.last }.uniq.size > 1
      end
    end
  end
  
  # Can then invoke your proxy methods directly on parents
  person.parents.divorced?
