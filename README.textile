h1. Roxy (A ruby proxy library)

h2. Summary

Roxy is a basic proxy library that lets you quickly create proxies between your ruby objects.  Its syntax
is loosely based on "Association Extensions in ActiveRecord":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html
as that is a well-known use of proxies.

Please see the "CHANGELOG":http://github.com/yfactorial/utility_scopes/tree/master/CHANGELOG for contribution details. 

Roxy has the following dependencies:

* rspec >= 1.1.4 (for specs only, not runtime)

h2. Installation

To install the roxy gem run the following:

  sudo gem install yfactorial-roxy
  
And to enable the scopes in your project just require the @roxy@ library and give your object some moxie:

  require 'roxy'
  class Person
    include Roxy::Moxie
    ...
  end
